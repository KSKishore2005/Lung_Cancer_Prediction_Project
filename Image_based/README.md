# Lung Cancer Detection - Image-Based

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting lung cancer from CT scan images using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It replicates and adapts a 2024 Kaggle notebook with enhancements and performance evaluation.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled lung CT images, used to train and evaluate the classification model.

> 📌 Note: Due to large size, the dataset is stored locally or can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/susenavenkatesh/lung-cancer-detection-ml-project-2024/notebook).

## 📒 Notebook
- `Image_prediction.ipynb`: Performs preprocessing, image augmentation, model building (possibly CNN), training, and evaluation.

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow / keras
- OpenCV (if used for image handling)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Download or place image dataset into the `image_based/data/` folder.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Launch `Image_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
4. Run the cells to train and evaluate the model.

## 📈 Output
The notebook displays training accuracy, validation accuracy, loss curves, and sample predictions on test images.

## 🎥 Demo
A result video is available in the `/result_video/` folder for visual understanding of the process and results.
