# Lung Cancer Prediction - Text-Based

## 📋 Project Overview
This project aims to predict lung cancer presence using survey data. It uses machine learning models trained on features like smoking habits, anxiety, and other personal and medical attributes.

## 📂 Dataset
- `survey lung cancer.csv`: Contains survey responses from individuals, including health and lifestyle data.

## 📒 Notebook
- `TEXT_Prediction.ipynb`: Contains data preprocessing, model training (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest), evaluation, and performance metrics.

## 📊 Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Run all cells in `TEXT_Prediction.ipynb`.

## 📈 Output
The model outputs accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix for evaluation.
