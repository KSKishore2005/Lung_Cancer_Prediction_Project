# Lung Cancer Prediction Project

This project aims to predict lung cancer using both image-based deep learning and text-based machine learning models. It compares the performance of these approaches using various evaluation metrics to identify the most effective solution.

## 🧠 Approaches Used

- **Image-based Prediction**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze CT scan images.
- **Text-based Prediction**: Uses structured patient data and applies machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## 📦 Requirements

Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you're working with image data, install and configure Git LFS:

bash
Copy
Edit
git lfs install
git lfs pull
💡 Key Highlights
CNN model achieved the highest accuracy and F1 score for image-based prediction.

Random Forest and SVM performed well on structured data.

Includes detailed preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.

📁 Dataset
Image-based: CT scan images of lung tissue (stored with Git LFS).

Text-based: Tabular data including patient attributes and diagnosis.
